## Pre-requisites

## How to build

## Running the MRG

At present, there are two way in which to generate a Machine-readable glossary:

1. By running the tool on a set of local scope files, e.g. that have been cloned from GitHub
2. By connecting to an external GitHub repository using an authentication token

In both cases the MRG will be generated *on your local machine* and can then be verified before
pushing
to source control.
